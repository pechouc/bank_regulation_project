# Project Presentation

This repository is part of an academic project conducted by Aurel Mélard, Victor Morisson and Paul-Emmanuel Chouc in the first year of the Master in Economics of Institut Polytechnique de Paris and under the supervision of Prof. Jean-Marc Bourgeon.

The goal of this project is to explore the rationale behind regulatory policies imposed to the financial sector and to analyse, from a theoretical standpoint, their efficiency. It mainly builds up on the "The three pillars of Basel II: optimizing the mix", a paper published by Jean-Paul Decamps, Jean-Charles Rochet and Benoît Roger in the *Journal of Financial Intermediation* in 2002.

This repository hosts the code written so as to run simulations of the model developed by aforementioned authors and to test its applicability to macroeconomic shock scenarios.

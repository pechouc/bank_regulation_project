This module is the central one in the bank regulation project.

It defines two classes, TypicalBank and Economy, whose methods we use to run simulations.

Formulas, assumptions and economic interpretations used throughout the file are taken from &#34;The three pillars of Basel
II: optimizing the mix&#34;, a paper published by Jean-Paul Decamps, Jean-Charles Rochet and Benoît Roger in the &#34;Journal of
Financial Intermediation&#34; in 2002.

Details about how the simulations are conceived can be found in the description of each class and of related methods.

class TypicalBank:

    def __init__(self, x_0, b, r, mu_G, sigma_G, mu_B, sigma_B):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This is the instantiation method for the TypicalBank class.

        It requires as arguments:

        - x_0: the initial value of the bank&#39;s cash flows;

        - b: the monitoring cost associated with the good asset management technology;

        - r: the interest rate;

        - mu_G: the instantaneous drift associated with the good asset management technology;

        - mu_B: the instantaneous drift associated with the bad asset management technology;

        - sigma_G: the instantaneous variance associated with the good asset management technology;

        - sigma_B: the instantaneous variance associated with the bad asset management technology.

        Based on these parameters, the expected present value of the bank&#39;s cash flows from time 0 onwards is computed
        for both the good and the bad technologies, so as to determine with what technology the bank starts.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        self.cash_flows = [x_0]

        self.b = b
        self.r = r

        self.mu_G = mu_G
        self.sigma_G = sigma_G

        self.mu_B = mu_B
        self.sigma_B = sigma_B

        # We compare the expected present value of the bank&#39;s cash flows with the good and the bad technology
        if (x_0 / (self.r - self.mu_G) - self.b) &gt;= (x_0 / (self.r - self.mu_B)):

            # If condition is satisfied, the bank first chooses the good asset management technology
            self.technology_choices = [&#39;good&#39;]

        else:

            # If condition is not satisfied, the bank first chooses the bad asset management technology
            self.technology_choices = [&#39;bad&#39;]

    def generate_cash_flows(self, n_periods=200, dt=0.01, random_seed=None, verbose=0):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to simulate the cash flows of the bank.

        It does not return any output but modifies the &#34;cash_flows&#34; and &#34;technology_choices&#34; attribute of the instance
        of the TypicalBank class considered.

        It takes as arguments:

        - n_periods: the number of time increments covered by the simulation (cash flows composed of n_periods values);

        - dt: the length of each time step which is used to simulate a Geometric Brownian motion as a discrete sequence;

        - random_seed: an integer that allows to pre-determine the &#34;state of the world&#34; for the simulation (ie. several
        simulations with the same random seed yield the same output);

        - verbose: determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have been updated.

        In order to run the simulation, this function relies on the generate_GBM function, imported from utils.py and
        called at each time increment. We cannot generate directly a n_periods-long cash flow series since at any point
        in time, the bank should have the possibility to &#34;shirk&#34;, ie. to move from the good to the bad technology.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # If a random seed is specified, this means that we want the same output each time we call this method
        if random_seed is not None:
            # To do so, we use the provided random seed to generate (the draw is random but we will always obtain the
            # same with a given seed) n_periods random seeds which will be used when calling the generate_GBM function
            np.random.seed(random_seed)
            random_seeds = np.random.randint(1, 1000000, size=n_periods)

        # We iterate to simulate a n_periods-long geometric Brownian motion
        for i in range(n_periods - 1):
            # We fetch the current technology choice of the bank from the related instance attribute
            technology = self.technology_choices[-1]

            # We use this technology choice to determine what mu and sigma to use at this time step
            if technology == &#39;good&#39;:
                mu = self.mu_G
                sigma = self.sigma_G
            else:
                mu = self.mu_B
                sigma = self.sigma_B

            # We fetch the current level of cash flows of the bank from the related instance attribute
            x_t = self.cash_flows[-1]

            # Here, we distinguish two cases depending on whether a random seed was specified or not
            if random_seed is not None:

                # We use the n-periods random seeds we have generated to determine the &#34;state of the world&#34; in which
                # the simulation of the geometric Brownian motion at the (i+1)-th time step occurs
                gbm_draw = generate_GBM(mu=mu, sigma=sigma, n=1, dt=dt, x_0=x_t, random_seed=random_seeds[i])[-1]

            else:

                # Here, we do not specify any random seed and let the generate_GBM function run undeterministically
                gbm_draw = generate_GBM(mu=mu, sigma=sigma, n=1, dt=dt, x_0=x_t)[-1]

            # We append the new cash flow level of the bank to its cash_flows attribute
            self.cash_flows.append(gbm_draw)

            # And we determine the next technology choice of the bank based on this cash_flow level
            if (self.cash_flows[-1] / (self.r - self.mu_G) - self.b) &gt; (self.cash_flows[-1] / (self.r - self.mu_B)):
                self.technology_choices.append(&#39;good&#39;)
            else:
                self.technology_choices.append(&#39;bad&#39;)

        if verbose:
            print(&#39;Cash-flow and technology choice attributes were updated.&#39;)

    def plot_cash_flows(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to rapidly plot the cash flows of the bank.

        It does not require any argument but runs a check to verify that cash flows have been generated beforehand.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # This check ensures that some cash flows have been generated beforehand
        if len(self.cash_flows) == 1:
            raise Exception(&#34;Run a simulation of the bank&#39;s cash flows before plotting them.&#34;)

        # We simply output a lineplot of the bank&#39;s cash flows (the x-axis corresponding to periods)
        plt.plot(self.cash_flows)

        plt.xlabel(&#39;Period&#39;)
        plt.ylabel(&#39;Cash-flow level&#39;)

        plt.title(&#34;Bank&#39;s simulated cash-flows&#34;)

        plt.show()

    def has_shirked(self):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to check whether a bank has shirked, ie. has chosen the bad technology at some point in time,
        or not.

        It does not require any argument and outputs a boolean which is:

        - True: the bank has shirked, ie. has chosen the bad technology at some point in time;
        - False: the bank has not shirked and kept running with the good technology throughout time.

        NB: Here, we do not run any check to verify for instance whether cash flows have been generated in the first
        place because the first cash flow level, x_0, is determined at the instantiation of the bank and if low enough,
        can potentially induce the bank to choose the bad technology from start.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        return (&#39;bad&#39; in self.technology_choices)


class Economy:

    def __init__(self, b, r, mu_G, sigma_G, mu_B, sigma_B, lambda_parameter):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This is the instantiation method for the Economy class.

        It requires as arguments:

        - b: the monitoring cost associated with the good asset management technology;

        - r: the interest rate;

        - mu_G: the instantaneous drift associated with the good asset management technology;

        - mu_B: the instantaneous drift associated with the bad asset management technology;

        - sigma_G: the instantaneous variance associated with the good asset management technology;

        - sigma_B: the instantaneous variance associated with the bad asset management technology;

        - lambda_parameter, which corresponds to lambda in the paper by Decamps, Rochet and Roger and, ie. the parameter
        that determines the liquidation value (lambda * x) of each bank in the economy;

        - d: the amount of (risky) deposits held by each bank in the economy.

        Beside instantiation itself, this method runs several checks on provided parameters to verify that the various
        assumptions posed by authors do hold.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # Assumption that needs to hold for most computations in the paper (mentioned p. 137)

        if mu_G &lt; mu_B:
            raise Exception(&#39;Due to the &#34;hierarchy&#34; between good and bad technologies, mu_G must be above mu_B.&#39;)

        if sigma_B &lt; sigma_G:
            raise Exception(&#39;Because the bad technology is more risky, sigma_B must be above sigma_G.&#39;)

        # This check verifies a technical assumption made by authors on GBM parameters
        if sigma_G ** 2 &gt;= ((mu_G + mu_B) / 2):
            raise Exception(&#39;Technical assumption not satisfied (cf. page 138 of the paper).&#39;)

        # Assumption on the lambda parameter
        # Eg., the lower bound implies that closure is always preferable to letting a bank run with the bad technology
        if (lambda_parameter &lt; 1 / (r - mu_B)) or (lambda_parameter &gt; 1 / (r - mu_G)):
            error_message = &#39;Condition on the lambda parameter is not satisfied. In this case, &#39;
            error_message += f&#39;value must lie between {round(1 / (r - mu_B), 2)} and {round(1 / (r - mu_G), 2)}.&#39;
            raise Exception(error_message)

        # This check and the one below are related to the bank&#39;s liabilities (detailed at p. 141)
        if r / (r - mu_G) - 1 &lt;= 0:
            raise Exception(&#39;When liquidation takes place, the book value of the bank equity must be positive.&#39;)

        if r * lambda_parameter &gt;= 1:
            raise Exception(&#39;Liquidation should not permit the repayment of all deposits, which would not be risky.&#39;)

    def get_one_bank(self, x_0):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to instantiate a bank, using economy-wide parameters.

        It only requires x_0 as an argument, which corresponds to the initial cash flow level of the bank.

        It returns an instance from the TypicalBank class, defined aboveself.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        return TypicalBank(x_0=x_0,
                           b=self.b, r=self.r,
                           mu_G=self.mu_G, sigma_G=self.sigma_G,
                           mu_B=self.mu_B, sigma_B=self.sigma_B)

    def run_first_simulation(self, n_banks=100,
                             lower_x_0=2, upper_x_0=5,
                             n_periods=200, dt=0.01,
                             fix_random_state=False,
                             inplace=True):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method is the core simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        It requires several arguments:

        - n_banks: the number of banks to include in the simulation;

        - lower_x_0: the lower bound for the support of the uniform distribution that determines the initial cash flow
        level of each bank;

        - upper_x_0: the upper bound for the support of the uniform distribution that determines the initial cash flow
        level of each bank;

        - n_periods: the number of periods during which one wants to simulate the banks&#39; cash flows;

        - dt: the timestep to be used when generating banks&#39; cash flows using geometric Brownian motions;

        - fix_random_state: boolean that indicates whether to fix or not the random state of the simulation. If set to
        True, the output of the method will be the same through a call to another; if set to False, different calls will
        of the method will yield different outputs;

        - inplace: boolean to indicate whether to store the output in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False). In the latter case, simulation attri-
        bute is not modified.

        Based on these arguments and using the generate_cash_flows method of TypicalBank instances, this method instan-
        tiate a number of banks, simulates their cash flows and determines whether they have shirked or reached a nega-
        tive surplus at some point in time, ie. the net present value of their assets is lower than the liquidation
        value of the bank.

        point in time;

        - with an additional &#34;has_shirked&#34; column which indicates whether the bank has chosen the bad technology at some
        point in time or not;

        - and a last &#34;has_shirked_or_neg_NPV&#34; which stores booleans. True indicates that the bank has either shirked or
        reached a negative surplus at some point in time (which is possible with the good technology when cash flows are
        insufficient to compensate for the monitoring cost).

        This function allows to initiate the analysis and simulation of a macroeconomic shock and its effect on bank
        regulation challenges or policies. It encompasses three main objectives:

        - running a variety of checks on the parameters of the macroeconomic shock to simulate;

        - storing these as attributes of the Economy instance;

        - running a few computations which are used in the following methods to simulate and analyse the shock.

        It requires several arguments, that we now detail.

        As a macroeconomic shock leads the regulator to make two different assumptions about its consequences on banks&#39;
        future profitability - the two scenarios respectively corresponding to a &#34;severe&#34; and a &#34;light&#34; outcome -, we
        need for each of the two outcomes:

        - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good asset monitoring technology.
        It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_G and light_outcome_mu_G arguments;

        - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad asset monitoring technology.
        It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_B and light_outcome_mu_B arguments;

        - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good technology. It is given
        in the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_G and light_outcome_sigma_G arguments;

        - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad technology. It is given in
        the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_B and light_outcome_sigma_B arguments.

        Besides, the method requires two additional arguments:

        - severe_outcome_proba, which corresponds to the probability (float must thus be comprised between 0 and 1) that
        the severe outcome realizes. It is assumed to be properly evaluated by the regulator;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the shock initiation.

        This method allows to compute and apply the first-best closure threshold of the regulator, ie. the one which
        maximizes the continuation value of banks in the economy, updated with the parameters of the macroeconomic
        shock (that has to be initiated in the first place).

        As before, it is based on the formula described in Proposition 1 (page 140 of the paper).

        In practice, the first step is to compute this threshold for both the severe outcome and the light outcome that
        may both actually realize with some probability. Then, depending on the &#34;strategy&#34; passed as argument (more on
        this below), an aggregated threshold is determined. Eventually, a check is run on the last cash-flow level of
        each bank to verify whether it is above or below the new closure threshold.

        The method then creates a new column, &#39;first_best_closure_under_shock&#39;, which takes the value:

        - True, if the bank should have been closed based on the new threshold at the time of the shock;

        - False, if not.

        It requires three arguments:

        - strategy: this argument, that can take either &#34;balanced&#34; or &#34;prudent&#34; as value, indicates what method to use
        when aggregating the severe outcome and light outcome thresholds:

            - &#34;balanced&#34; would correspond to a risk-neutral regulator and in this case, the threshold applied is the
            mean of the severe and light outcome thresholds,

            - &#34;prudent&#34; would instead correspond to an extremely risk-averse regulator, in which case the severe outcome
            threshold is directly applied;

        - inplace: this boolean indicates whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False). It is set to
        True by default;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the application of the
        new closure threshold.

        This is the second simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        It builds upon the first simulation of cash flows to pursue each bank&#39;s sequence after a macroeconomic shock.
        A first simulation must have been run and a macroeconomic shock must have been initiated beforehand, respective-
        ly with the run_first_simulation and initiate_macro_shock methods.

        It requires several arguments:

        - n_periods, the number of periods during which one wants to simulate the banks&#39; cash flows after the shock;

        - fix_random_state, a boolean which indicates whether to fix the random state of the simulation. If it is set to
        True, the output will be the same from a run to another while the output is allowed to vary if False is passed;

        - selected_outcome, this argument is required if and only if one wants to fix the random state for the simula-
        tion. Either &#34;severe&#34; or &#34;light&#34; can be passed, determining what set of parameters will be used to generate
        banks&#39; cash flows under the shock. If a selected_outcome is specified while passing fix_random_state=False, this
        will have no impact on the simulation and the realized outcome will be determined randomly.

        - inplace, set to True by default, specifies whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy
        instance (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False).

        It either updates the simulation attribute of the Economy instance or returns a copy with several new columns:

        - n_periods columns (for instance denominated by &#34;cf_200&#34;, &#34;cf_399&#34;, etc), which store the cash flow levels of
        each bank at each point in time after the macroeconomic shock;

        - a &#34;has_shirked_post_shock&#34; column which indicates whether the bank has chosen the bad technology at some
        point in time after the macroeconomic shock or not;

        - and a last &#34;has_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock&#34; which stores booleans. True indicates that the bank has either
        shirked or reached a negative surplus at some point in time after the shock (which is possible with the good
        technology when cash flows are insufficient to compensate for the monitoring cost).

        NB: This final column is built using the NPV_check function imported from the utils module.

        at some point in time.

        This function allows to plot the output of pre-shock and post-shock simulations of banks&#39; cash flows.

        Based on the results stored in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance, it returns a simple line plot
        of the cash flow sequences of a sub-sample of banks, chosen randomly. The color of the line is determined by the
        bank&#39;s choice of technology before or after the macroeconomic shock.

        This method requires two arguments:

        - n_lines (no default value), which determines how many cash flow sequences one wants to visualize. From there,
        the method will draw without replacement n_lines banks from the simulation and display their results;

        - plot_shock is a boolean that indicates whether to plot only cash flows before the macroeconomic shock or both
        pre-shock and post-shock sequences. Indeed, the form of the graph (as described below) differs beween these two
        cases. Naturally, to pass plot_shock=True, it is necessary to simulate a macroeconomic shock in the first place.

        &#39;&#39;&#39;
        This is the third and final simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        This method allows to run Monte-Carlo simulations of the model, in the sense that a large number of Economy in-
        stances are created, so as to run multiple random simulations and draw aggregate results from there.

        As such, this method requires a macroeconomic shock to have been initiated beforehand as the same &#34;normal
        state&#34;, severe outcome and light outcome parameters will be used throughout the different trials.

        Four arguments are necessary:

        - n_trials (200 by default), which determines how many Economy instances are created and therefore, how many si-
        mulations will be run;

        - n_banks (100 by default), which determines how many banks will be simulated in each Economy instance;

        - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
        of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

        - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
        been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

        The output of this method is a DataFrame which contains one line for each trial and the following columns:

        - n_have_shirked: number of banks having shirked before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV: number of banks having shirked or reached a negative surplus before the macroecono-
        mic shock;

        - n_first_best_closures: number of banks that should be closed based on the first-best closure threshold of the
        regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_capital_requirements_closure: number of banks that should be closed based on the second-best or capital re-
        quirements closure threshold of the regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_first_best_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (in the sense that they were not
        closed before the macroeconomic shock based on the first-best closure of the regulator) that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_first_best_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent first-best closure threshold
        of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (this time referring to
        the capital requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced capital requirements closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent capital requirements
        closure threshold of the regulator;

        - realized_outcome: stores the outcome (either &#34;light&#34; or &#34;severe&#34;) that randomly realized when simulating the
        macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had not shirked before the macroeconomic shock,
        that have shirked after the shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had neither shirked nor reached a ne-
        gative surplus before the macroeconomic shock, that have either shirked or reached a negative surplus after the
        shock;

        - n_first_best_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, applying the new balanced
        first-best closure threshold;

        - n_capital_requirements_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the capital
        requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, apply-
        ing the new balanced capital requirements closure threshold.

        Because computations required by the Monte-Carlo simulation can be heavy, this method allows to fetch the re-
        sults of simulations already run and stored online.

        It requires three arguments:

        - file_id, which indicates what pre-saved simulation results to fetch. Following options are available so far:

            - 0 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulation run with 250 trials, with 200 banks each. The set of paramaters
            used corresponds to the past calibration (more details can be found in the README file inside the simula-
            tions folder);

            - 1 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulation run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. Here again, the set
            of parameters corresponds to the first one used;

            - 2 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulaton run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. The set of parameters
            used corresponds to the latest version of the calibration;

            - 3 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulaton run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. The set of parameters
            used corresponds to the latest version of the calibration and it includes an additional column, indicating
            the outcome realized during the simulation of the macroeconomic shock for each trial.

        - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
        of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

        - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
        been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

        This function allows to plot histograms that describe the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation.

        For each of the columns of the monte_carlo_simulation DataFrame, it returns a histogram of the results, with

        This method allows to instantiate a bank, using economy-wide parameters.

        It only requires x_0 as an argument, which corresponds to the initial cash flow level of the bank.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method is the core simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        It requires several arguments:

        - n_banks: the number of banks to include in the simulation;

        - lower_x_0: the lower bound for the support of the uniform distribution that determines the initial cash flow
        level of each bank;

        - upper_x_0: the upper bound for the support of the uniform distribution that determines the initial cash flow
        level of each bank;

        - n_periods: the number of periods during which one wants to simulate the banks&#39; cash flows;

        - dt: the timestep to be used when generating banks&#39; cash flows using geometric Brownian motions;

        - fix_random_state: boolean that indicates whether to fix or not the random state of the simulation. If set to
        True, the output of the method will be the same through a call to another; if set to False, different calls will
        of the method will yield different outputs;

        - inplace: boolean to indicate whether to store the output in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False). In the latter case, simulation attri-
        bute is not modified.

        Based on these arguments and using the generate_cash_flows method of TypicalBank instances, this method instan-
        tiate a number of banks, simulates their cash flows and determines whether they have shirked or reached a nega-
        tive surplus at some point in time, ie. the net present value of their assets is lower than the liquidation
        value of the bank.

        It returns a DataFrame:

        - indexed by banks&#39; ID, which range from 1 to n_banks;

        - whose n_periods first columns (called &#34;cf_0&#34;, &#34;cf_1&#34;, etc) store the cash flow levels of each bank at each
        point in time;

        - with an additional &#34;has_shirked&#34; column which indicates whether the bank has chosen the bad technology at some
        point in time or not;

        - and a last &#34;has_shirked_or_neg_NPV&#34; which stores booleans. True indicates that the bank has either shirked or
        reached a negative surplus at some point in time (which is possible with the good technology when cash flows are
        insufficient to compensate for the monitoring cost).

        NB: This final column is built using the NPV_check function imported from the utils module.

        This function allows to initiate the analysis and simulation of a macroeconomic shock and its effect on bank
        regulation challenges or policies. It encompasses three main objectives:

        - running a variety of checks on the parameters of the macroeconomic shock to simulate;

        - storing these as attributes of the Economy instance;

        - running a few computations which are used in the following methods to simulate and analyse the shock.

        It requires several arguments, that we now detail.

        As a macroeconomic shock leads the regulator to make two different assumptions about its consequences on banks&#39;
        future profitability - the two scenarios respectively corresponding to a &#34;severe&#34; and a &#34;light&#34; outcome -, we
        need for each of the two outcomes:

        - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good asset monitoring technology.
        It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_G and light_outcome_mu_G arguments;

        - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad asset monitoring technology.
        It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_B and light_outcome_mu_B arguments;

        - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good technology. It is given
        in the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_G and light_outcome_sigma_G arguments;

        - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad technology. It is given in
        the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_B and light_outcome_sigma_B arguments.

        Besides, the method requires two additional arguments:

        - severe_outcome_proba, which corresponds to the probability (float must thus be comprised between 0 and 1) that
        the severe outcome realizes. It is assumed to be properly evaluated by the regulator;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the shock initiation.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to compute and apply the first-best closure threshold of the regulator, ie. the one which
        maximizes the continuation value of banks in the economy, updated with the parameters of the macroeconomic
        shock (that has to be initiated in the first place).

        As before, it is based on the formula described in Proposition 1 (page 140 of the paper).

        In practice, the first step is to compute this threshold for both the severe outcome and the light outcome that
        may both actually realize with some probability. Then, depending on the &#34;strategy&#34; passed as argument (more on
        this below), an aggregated threshold is determined. Eventually, a check is run on the last cash-flow level of
        each bank to verify whether it is above or below the new closure threshold.

        The method then creates a new column, &#39;first_best_closure_under_shock&#39;, which takes the value:

        - True, if the bank should have been closed based on the new threshold at the time of the shock;

        - False, if not.

        It requires three arguments:

        - strategy: this argument, that can take either &#34;balanced&#34; or &#34;prudent&#34; as value, indicates what method to use
        when aggregating the severe outcome and light outcome thresholds:

            - &#34;balanced&#34; would correspond to a risk-neutral regulator and in this case, the threshold applied is the
            mean of the severe and light outcome thresholds,

            - &#34;prudent&#34; would instead correspond to an extremely risk-averse regulator, in which case the severe outcome
            threshold is directly applied;

        - inplace: this boolean indicates whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False). It is set to
        True by default;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the application of the
        new closure threshold.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method allows to compute and apply the second-best closure threshold of the regulator, ie. the one which is
        assimilated with a capital requirements ratio in the paper, updated with the parameters of the macroeconomic
        shock (that has to be initiated in the first place).

        As before, it is based on the formula described in Proposition 2 (page 143 of the paper).

        In practice, the first step is to compute this threshold for both the severe outcome and the light outcome that
        may both actually realize with some probability. Then, depending on the &#34;strategy&#34; passed as argument (more on
        this below), an aggregated threshold is determined. Eventually, a check is run on the last cash-flow level of
        each bank to verify whether it is above or below the new closure threshold.

        The method then creates a new column, &#39;capital_requirements_closure_under_shock&#39;, which takes the value:

        - True, if the bank should have been closed based on the new threshold at the time of the shock;

        - False, if not.

        It requires three arguments:

        - strategy (&#34;balanced&#34; by default): this argument, that can take either &#34;balanced&#34; or &#34;prudent&#34; as value, indi-
        cates what method to use when aggregating the severe outcome and light outcome thresholds:

            - &#34;balanced&#34; would correspond to a risk-neutral regulator and in this case, the threshold applied is the
            mean of the severe and light outcome thresholds,

            - &#34;prudent&#34; would instead correspond to an extremely risk-averse regulator, in which case the severe outcome
            threshold is directly applied.

        - inplace: this boolean indicates whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False). It is set to
        True by default;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the application of the
        new closure threshold.

        This is the second simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        It builds upon the first simulation of cash flows to pursue each bank&#39;s sequence after a macroeconomic shock.
        A first simulation must have been run and a macroeconomic shock must have been initiated beforehand, respective-
        ly with the run_first_simulation and initiate_macro_shock methods.

        It requires several arguments:

        - n_periods, the number of periods during which one wants to simulate the banks&#39; cash flows after the shock;

        - fix_random_state, a boolean which indicates whether to fix the random state of the simulation. If it is set to
        True, the output will be the same from a run to another while the output is allowed to vary if False is passed;

        - selected_outcome, this argument is required if and only if one wants to fix the random state for the simula-
        tion. Either &#34;severe&#34; or &#34;light&#34; can be passed, determining what set of parameters will be used to generate
        banks&#39; cash flows under the shock. If a selected_outcome is specified while passing fix_random_state=False, this
        will have no impact on the simulation and the realized outcome will be determined randomly.

        - inplace, set to True by default, specifies whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy
        instance (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False).

        It either updates the simulation attribute of the Economy instance or returns a copy with several new columns:

        - n_periods columns (for instance denominated by &#34;cf_200&#34;, &#34;cf_399&#34;, etc), which store the cash flow levels of
        each bank at each point in time after the macroeconomic shock;

        - a &#34;has_shirked_post_shock&#34; column which indicates whether the bank has chosen the bad technology at some
        point in time after the macroeconomic shock or not;

        - and a last &#34;has_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock&#34; which stores booleans. True indicates that the bank has either
        shirked or reached a negative surplus at some point in time after the shock (which is possible with the good
        technology when cash flows are insufficient to compensate for the monitoring cost).

        NB: This final column is built using the NPV_check function imported from the utils module.

        This method applies to banks&#39; post-shock cash-flow levels the first-best closure threshold of the regulator,
        updated with the parameters of the macroeconomic shock.

        Assumingly, the regulator uses, in the n_periods after the shock, the balanced first-best closure threshold that
        has been computed and stored in the attributes of the Economy instance within the apply_first_best_closure_-
        under_shock method (which therefore has to be run in the first place).

        In this method, the first step is thus to fetch the relevant threshold from pre-stored attributes. A check is
        then run on each bank&#39;s post-shock cash-flow levels to verify whether they have gone below the closure threshold
        at some point in time.

        It then creates a new column, &#39;first_best_closure_post_shock&#39;, which takes the value:

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This method applies to banks&#39; post-shock cash-flow levels the second-best or capital requirements closure
        threshold of the regulator, updated with the parameters of the macroeconomic shock.

        Assumingly, the regulator uses, in the n_periods after the shock, the balanced capital requirements closure
        threshold that has been computed and stored in the attributes of the Economy instance within the apply_capital_-
        requirements_under_shock method (which therefore has to be run in the first place).

        In this method, the first step is thus to fetch the relevant threshold from pre-stored attributes. A check is
        then run on each bank&#39;s post-shock cash-flow levels to verify whether they have gone below the closure threshold
        at some point in time.

        It then creates a new column, &#39;capital_requirements_closure_post_shock&#39;, which takes the value:

        - True, if the bank should have been closed at some point in time after the shock based on the new threshold;

        - False, if not.

        This method takes two simple arguments:

        - inplace: boolean to indicate whether to store the output in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
        without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False). In the latter case, simulation attri-
        bute is not modified;

        - verbose: determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have been updated, as
        well as the threshold actually applied.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        This function allows to plot the output of pre-shock and post-shock simulations of banks&#39; cash flows.

        Based on the results stored in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance, it returns a simple line plot
        of the cash flow sequences of a sub-sample of banks, chosen randomly. The color of the line is determined by the
        bank&#39;s choice of technology before or after the macroeconomic shock.

        This method requires two arguments:

        - n_lines (no default value), which determines how many cash flow sequences one wants to visualize. From there,
        the method will draw without replacement n_lines banks from the simulation and display their results;

        - plot_shock is a boolean that indicates whether to plot only cash flows before the macroeconomic shock or both
        pre-shock and post-shock sequences. Indeed, the form of the graph (as described below) differs beween these two
        cases. Naturally, to pass plot_shock=True, it is necessary to simulate a macroeconomic shock in the first place.

        &#39;&#39;&#39;
        This is the third and final simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        This method allows to run Monte-Carlo simulations of the model, in the sense that a large number of Economy in-
        stances are created, so as to run multiple random simulations and draw aggregate results from there.

        As such, this method requires a macroeconomic shock to have been initiated beforehand as the same &#34;normal
        state&#34;, severe outcome and light outcome parameters will be used throughout the different trials.

        Four arguments are necessary:

        - n_trials (200 by default), which determines how many Economy instances are created and therefore, how many si-
        mulations will be run;

        - n_banks (100 by default), which determines how many banks will be simulated in each Economy instance;

        - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
        of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

        - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
        been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

        The output of this method is a DataFrame which contains one line for each trial and the following columns:

        - n_have_shirked: number of banks having shirked before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV: number of banks having shirked or reached a negative surplus before the macroecono-
        mic shock;

        - n_first_best_closures: number of banks that should be closed based on the first-best closure threshold of the
        regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_capital_requirements_closure: number of banks that should be closed based on the second-best or capital re-
        quirements closure threshold of the regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_first_best_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (in the sense that they were not
        closed before the macroeconomic shock based on the first-best closure of the regulator) that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_first_best_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent first-best closure threshold
        of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (this time referring to
        the capital requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced capital requirements closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent capital requirements
        closure threshold of the regulator;

        - realized_outcome: stores the outcome (either &#34;light&#34; or &#34;severe&#34;) that randomly realized when simulating the
        macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had not shirked before the macroeconomic shock,
        that have shirked after the shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had neither shirked nor reached a ne-
        gative surplus before the macroeconomic shock, that have either shirked or reached a negative surplus after the
        shock;

        - n_first_best_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, applying the new balanced
        first-best closure threshold;

        - n_capital_requirements_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the capital
        requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, apply-
        ing the new balanced capital requirements closure threshold.

        Because computations required by the Monte-Carlo simulation can be heavy, this method allows to fetch the re-
        sults of simulations already run and stored online.

        It requires three arguments:

        - file_id, which indicates what pre-saved simulation results to fetch. Following options are available so far:

            - 0 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulation run with 250 trials, with 200 banks each. The set of paramaters
            used corresponds to the past calibration (more details can be found in the README file inside the simula-
            tions folder);

            - 1 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulation run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. Here again, the set
            of parameters corresponds to the first one used;

            - 2 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulaton run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. The set of parameters
            used corresponds to the latest version of the calibration;

            - 3 gives access to a Monte-Carlo simulaton run with 250 trials, with 500 banks each. The set of parameters
            used corresponds to the latest version of the calibration and it includes an additional column, indicating
            the outcome realized during the simulation of the macroeconomic shock for each trial.

        - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
        of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

        - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
        been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

    Based on the formula described in Proposition 1 (page 140 of the paper), this method applies the first-best clo-
    sure threshold of the regulator, ie. the threshold which maximizes the option value associated to the irreversi-
    ble closure decision.

    In practice, the first step is to compute this threshold using the parameters of the economy and then, a check
    is run upon each line of the simulation DataFrame to verify, for each bank, whether its cash flows have gone
    below the closure threshold at some point in time.

    It then creates a new column, &#39;first_best_closure&#39;, which takes the value:

    - True, if the bank should have been closed at some point in time based on the first-best threshold;

    - False, if not.

    This method takes two simple arguments:

    - inplace: boolean to indicate whether to store the output in the simulation attribute of the Economy instance
    without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False). In the latter case, simulation attri-

    This function allows to initiate the analysis and simulation of a macroeconomic shock and its effect on bank
    regulation challenges or policies. It encompasses three main objectives:

    - running a variety of checks on the parameters of the macroeconomic shock to simulate;

    - storing these as attributes of the Economy instance;

    - running a few computations which are used in the following methods to simulate and analyse the shock.

    It requires several arguments, that we now detail.

    As a macroeconomic shock leads the regulator to make two different assumptions about its consequences on banks&#39;
    future profitability - the two scenarios respectively corresponding to a &#34;severe&#34; and a &#34;light&#34; outcome -, we
    need for each of the two outcomes:

    - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good asset monitoring technology.
    It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_G and light_outcome_mu_G arguments;

    - the instantaneous drift of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad asset monitoring technology.
    It is given in the two cases by the severe_outcome_mu_B and light_outcome_mu_B arguments;

    - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the good technology. It is given
    in the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_G and light_outcome_sigma_G arguments;

    - the instantaneous variance of the geometric Brownian motion associated with the bad technology. It is given in
    the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_B and light_outcome_sigma_B arguments.

    Besides, the method requires two additional arguments:

    - severe_outcome_proba, which corresponds to the probability (float must thus be comprised between 0 and 1) that
    the severe outcome realizes. It is assumed to be properly evaluated by the regulator;

    - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the shock initiation.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

    This method allows to run Monte-Carlo simulations of the model, in the sense that a large number of Economy in-
    stances are created, so as to run multiple random simulations and draw aggregate results from there.

    As such, this method requires a macroeconomic shock to have been initiated beforehand as the same &#34;normal
    state&#34;, severe outcome and light outcome parameters will be used throughout the different trials.

    Four arguments are necessary:

    - n_trials (200 by default), which determines how many Economy instances are created and therefore, how many si-
    mulations will be run;

    - n_banks (100 by default), which determines how many banks will be simulated in each Economy instance;

    - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
    of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

    - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
    been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

    The output of this method is a DataFrame which contains one line for each trial and the following columns:

    - n_have_shirked: number of banks having shirked before the macroeconomic shock;

    - n_first_best_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (in the sense that they were not
    closed before the macroeconomic shock based on the first-best closure of the regulator) that should be closed
    based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced first-best closure
    threshold of the regulator;

    their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent first-best closure threshold
    of the regulator;

    the capital requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed based on
    their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced capital requirements closure
    threshold of the regulator;

    - n_capital_requirements_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed
    based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent capital requirements
    closure threshold of the regulator;

    - realized_outcome: stores the outcome (either &#34;light&#34; or &#34;severe&#34;) that randomly realized when simulating the
    macroeconomic shock;

    - n_have_shirked_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had not shirked before the macroeconomic shock,
    that have shirked after the shock;

    gative surplus before the macroeconomic shock, that have either shirked or reached a negative surplus after the
    shock;

    - n_first_best_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the first-best closure
    threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, applying the new balanced
    first-best closure threshold;

    - n_capital_requirements_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the capital
    requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, apply-

        NB: Here, we do not run any check to verify for instance whether cash flows have been generated in the first
        place because the first cash flow level, x_0, is determined at the instantiation of the bank and if low enough,
        can potentially induce the bank to choose the bad technology from start.

This module is the central one in the bank regulation project.

It defines two classes, TypicalBank and Economy, whose methods we use to run simulations.

Formulas, assumptions and economic interpretations used throughout the file are taken from "The three pillars of Basel
II: optimizing the mix", a paper published by Jean-Paul Decamps, Jean-Charles Rochet and BenoÃ®t Roger in the "Journal of
Financial Intermediation" in 2002.

Details about how the simulations are conceived can be found in the description of each class and of related methods.

        without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False). In the latter case, simulation attri-
        bute is not modified;

        - verbose: determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have been updated.

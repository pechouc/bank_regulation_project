This module is the central one in the bank regulation project.

It defines two classes, TypicalBank and Economy, whose methods we use to run simulations.

Formulas, assumptions and economic interpretations used throughout the file are taken from "The three pillars of Basel
II: optimizing the mix", a paper published by Jean-Paul Decamps, Jean-Charles Rochet and BenoÃ®t Roger in the "Journal of
Financial Intermediation" in 2002.

Details about how the simulations are conceived can be found in the description of each class and of related methods.

        - storing these as attributes of the Economy instance;

        - running a few computations which are used in the following methods to simulate and analyse the shock.

        the two cases by the severe_outcome_sigma_B and light_outcome_sigma_B arguments.

        Besides, the method requires two additional arguments:

        - severe_outcome_proba, which corresponds to the probability (float must thus be comprised between 0 and 1) that
        the severe outcome realizes. It is assumed to be properly evaluated by the regulator;

        - verbose, which is equal to 1 by default, indicates whether to print a confirmation of the shock initiation.

        This is the second simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        It builds upon the first simulation of cash flows to pursue each bank's sequence after a macroeconomic shock.
        A first simulation must have been run and a macroeconomic shock must have been initiated beforehand, respective-
        ly with the run_first_simulation and initiate_macro_shock methods.

        It requires several arguments:

        - n_periods, the number of periods during which one wants to simulate the banks' cash flows after the shock;

        - fix_random_state, a boolean which indicates whether to fix the random state of the simulation. If it is set to
        True, the output will be the same from a run to another while the output is allowed to vary if False is passed;

        - selected_outcome, this argument is required if and only if one wants to fix the random state for the simula-
        tion. Either "severe" or "light" can be passed, determining what set of parameters will be used to generate
        banks' cash flows under the shock. If a selected_outcome is specified while passing fix_random_state=False, this
        will have no impact on the simulation and the realized outcome will be determined randomly.

        - inplace, set to True by default, specifies whether to directly update the simulation attribute of the Economy
        instance (inplace=True) or to return a copy of the simulation DataFrame with the new column (inplace=False).

        It either updates the simulation attribute of the Economy instance or returns a copy with several new columns:

        - n_periods columns (for instance denominated by "cf_200", "cf_399", etc), which store the cash flow levels of
        each bank at each point in time after the macroeconomic shock;

        - a "has_shirked_post_shock" column which indicates whether the bank has chosen the bad technology at some
        point in time after the macroeconomic shock or not;

        - and a last "has_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock" which stores booleans. True indicates that the bank has either
        shirked or reached a negative net present value at some point in time after the shock (which is possible with
        the good technology when cash flows are insufficient to compensate for the monitoring cost).

        NB: This final column is built using the NPV_check function imported from the utils module.

        This is the third and final simulation method provided by the Economy class.

        This method allows to run Monte-Carlo simulations of the model, in the sense that a large number of Economy in-
        stances are created, so as to run multiple random simulations and draw aggregate results from there.

        As such, this method requires a macroeconomic shock to have been initiated beforehand as the same "normal
        state", severe outcome and light outcome parameters will be used throughout the different trials.

        Four arguments are necessary:

        - n_trials (200 by default), which determines how many Economy instances are created and therefore, how many si-
        mulations will be run;

        - n_banks (100 by default), which determines how many banks will be simulated in each Economy instance;

        - inplace (True by default), which indicates whether to store the output in the monte_carlo_simulation attribute
        of the Economy instance without returning anything (True) or to return the output instead (False);

        - verbose (1 by default), which determines whether to print or not a message indicating that the attributes have
        been updated, as well as the threshold actually applied.

        The output of this method is a DataFrame which contains one line for each trial and the following columns:

        - n_have_shirked: number of banks having shirked before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV: number of banks having shirked or reached a negative net present value before the
        macroeconomic shock;

        - n_first_best_closures: number of banks that should be closed based on the first-best closure threshold of the
        regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_capital_requirements_closure: number of banks that should be closed based on the second-best or capital re-
        quirements closure threshold of the regulator before the macroeconomic shock;

        - n_first_best_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (in the sense that they were not
        closed before the macroeconomic shock based on the first-best closure of the regulator) that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_first_best_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent first-best closure threshold
        of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_balanced_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks (this time referring to
        the capital requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed based on
        their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the balanced capital requirements closure
        threshold of the regulator;

        - n_capital_requirements_prudent_closures_under_shock: number of previously sound banks that should be closed
        based on their cash flow level at the moment of the macroeconomic shock and on the prudent capital requirements
        closure threshold of the regulator;

        - realized_outcome: stores the outcome (either "light" or "severe") that randomly realized when simulating the
        macroeconomic shock;

        - n_have_shirked_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had not shirked before the macroeconomic shock,
        that have shirked after the shock;

        - n_have_shirked_or_neg_NPV_post_shock: number of banks, among those that had neither shirked nor reached a ne-
        gative NPV before the macroeconomic shock, that have either shirked or reached a negative NPV after the shock;

        - n_first_best_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the first-best closure
        threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, applying the new balanced
        first-best closure threshold;

        - n_capital_requirements_closures_post_shock: number of previously sound banks (not closed based on the capital
        requirements closure threshold of the regulator before the shock) that should be closed after the shock, apply-
        ing the new balanced capital requirements closure threshold.
